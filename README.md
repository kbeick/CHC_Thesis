#Ray Tracing with BVHs 
####Kevin Beick 2014  
####Clark Honors College Thesis Project  

Source code for the thesis "Analyzing Performance of Bounding Volume Hierarchies for Ray Tracing" by Kevin Beick in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the Robert D. Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon.

Some code herein is borrowed from or inspired by other implementations, as noted in the appropriate source files.


OVERVIEW
==========
This project is an implemenation of the Ray Tracing algorithm used to render 3D graphics. My algorithm uses Bounding Volume Hierarchies, data structures that accelerate the Ray Tracing process. This code loads data from .obj files and stores the model(s) as its constituent geometric objects. These objects are inserted into a BVH and then the ray tracing algorithm uses the BVH to efficiently generate a 3D rendering of the model (.png file) via Ray Tracing.

The code allows for some customization to the BVH and the ray tracing process, letting the user define some of the parameters:
- construction method used to generate BVH (top-down or bottom-up)
- branching factor of the BVH (2,4,8)
- depth of the trace (primary rays only, include secondary rays, etc.) 
- universal opacity of the model(s)
- view point in space (camera always faces the origin)

Also included is support to record/stream various metrics of the BVH's performance:
- Build Time
- Avg traversal time per pixel
- Avg number of nodes traverse per pixel

The goal of this codebase - and my project as a whole - was to gain an understanding of how a few of the most significant BVH design decisions affect a its performance during Ray Tracing.
